# Overseas Voting System

## Current process

Overseas Indians can cast their vote in Indian elections through the "Overseas Voters" option, which was introduced by the Indian government in 2010. Here is the process for overseas Indians to cast their vote in Indian elections:

1. Register as an overseas voter: To be eligible to vote in Indian elections, an overseas Indian must first register as an overseas voter. To do so, they must visit the website of the Election Commission of India ([https://www.eci.gov.in/](https://www.eci.gov.in/)) and click on the "Overseas Voters" tab. They will be directed to the National Voters' Service Portal ([https://www.nvsp.in/](https://www.nvsp.in/)), where they can register by filling out an online form and uploading the necessary documents. The documents required for registration include a copy of the applicant's passport and visa.
2. Receive confirmation and voter ID card: Once the registration is complete, the applicant will receive a confirmation email. They will also receive a voter ID card in the mail, which they can use to cast their vote.
3. Check voter list: Before the elections, the overseas Indian voter should check the voter list to ensure that their name is included. They can do so by visiting the National Voters' Service Portal ([https://www.nvsp.in/](https://www.nvsp.in/)) and entering their details.
4. Cast their vote: On the day of the election, the overseas Indian voter can cast their vote at the Indian mission or embassy in their country of residence. They must bring their voter ID card and a valid passport to the polling station. They will be given a ballot paper, which they can mark and submit in the ballot box.

It is important to note that overseas Indians can only vote in the Lok Sabha (lower house of Parliament) elections, and not in state or local elections. Also, the right to vote is available only to overseas Indians who have not acquired citizenship of any other country.

## Problems

The current overseas voting system for Indian citizens has some limitations and challenges that can be considered as problems. Here are some of the problems in the current overseas voting system for Indian citizens:

1. Limited availability of polling stations: Overseas Indian voters can only cast their vote at the Indian mission or embassy in their country of residence. This can be challenging for those who live far from the nearest polling station, as they may have to travel long distances to vote.
2. Limited time for voting: Overseas Indian voters have a limited time window to cast their vote, usually only a few hours on the day of the election. This can make it difficult for those who have work or other commitments during that time.
3. Lack of awareness and outreach: Many overseas Indian voters may not be aware of their right to vote or the registration process, or they may face difficulties in accessing the registration website due to technical issues or language barriers. The Indian government has made some efforts to raise awareness about the overseas voting system, but more outreach is needed to ensure that all eligible voters are able to exercise their right to vote.
4. Security concerns: The current overseas voting system relies on paper ballots, which can be vulnerable to tampering or manipulation. The Indian government has taken steps to improve the security of the voting process, but more needs to be done to ensure the integrity of the system.
5. Limited scope of elections: Overseas Indian voters can only vote in Lok Sabha elections, and not in state or local elections. This limits their ability to participate in the democratic process at all levels of government.

Overall, while the overseas voting system for Indian citizens is a step in the right direction, there is still room for improvement to ensure that all eligible voters are able to participate in the democratic process, regardless of their location.

## Solution

A blockchain solution that uses zero knowledge proofs to address the problems of the current overseas voting system for Indian citizens could work as follows:

1. Eligibility verification: To ensure that only eligible voters are able to register and vote, a zero knowledge proof (ZKP) protocol can be used to verify the voter's identity and citizenship. The voter would provide proof that they meet the eligibility criteria without revealing any personal information. This would eliminate the need for manual verification of documents and reduce the risk of fraud or manipulation.
2. Secure registration and voting: The voter would register online using a secure and decentralized blockchain platform that uses ZKPs to ensure the integrity of the process. The platform would generate a unique identifier for each voter that would be used to verify their identity and track their vote. The voter would then be able to cast their vote online using the same platform, which would ensure the security and privacy of the vote through ZKPs.
3. Decentralized verification and counting: The blockchain platform would be decentralized, with multiple nodes verifying and counting the votes to ensure accuracy and transparency. The ZKP protocol would ensure that the nodes cannot manipulate or tamper with the votes. The platform would also provide real-time updates on the vote count, which would increase transparency and trust in the process.
4. Increased accessibility: The blockchain platform would be accessible from anywhere in the world, allowing overseas Indian voters to cast their vote from the comfort of their own home or office. The platform would also be available for a longer period of time, allowing voters to cast their vote at their convenience.

By using a blockchain platform that utilizes zero knowledge proofs, the above problems of the current overseas voting system for Indian citizens can be addressed. The ZKP protocol would ensure the security, privacy, and integrity of the process, while the decentralized platform would increase transparency and accessibility.

## Substrate Blockchain & Zero Knowledge Proofs

A substrate blockchain solution that uses zero knowledge proofs to address the problems of the current overseas voting system for Indian citizens could work as follows:

1. Create a substrate blockchain: Create a substrate blockchain that is specifically designed for voting. This would allow the creation of a custom governance system that is secure, transparent, and efficient. The substrate blockchain would provide a solid foundation for the voting system and ensure that it is resistant to attacks and fraud.
2. Implement zero knowledge proofs: Integrate zero knowledge proofs into the substrate blockchain to ensure that the voting process is private, secure, and anonymous. Zero knowledge proofs can be used to ensure that the voting process is tamper-proof, while also maintaining the anonymity of the voter. This would ensure that the voting process is free and fair.
3. Decentralized network of nodes: Implement a decentralized network of nodes that validate the voting process. The nodes would ensure that the voting process is transparent, efficient, and fair. The decentralized network would provide a high level of security to the voting process, as it would be more difficult for attackers to target a single point of failure.
4. Custom governance system: Implement a custom governance system that is specifically designed for voting. The governance system would ensure that the voting process is transparent, efficient, and fair. This would ensure that the voting process is free from any kind of bias or interference.
5. Accessibility: The substrate blockchain voting platform would be accessible from anywhere in the world. This would ensure that overseas Indian voters can cast their vote from anywhere in the world. Additionally, the platform would be available for a longer period of time, allowing voters to cast their vote at their convenience.

By using a substrate blockchain that utilizes zero knowledge proofs, the above problems of the current overseas voting system for Indian citizens can be addressed. The zero knowledge proof would ensure the privacy, security, and anonymity of the voting process. Additionally, the decentralized network of nodes and custom governance system would ensure that the voting process is transparent, efficient, and fair. Finally, the accessibility of the platform would ensure that overseas Indian voters can cast their vote from anywhere in the world.
